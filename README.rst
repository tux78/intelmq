**IntelMQ** is a solution for IT security teams (CERTs & CSIRTs, SOCs, abuse
departments, etc.) for collecting and processing security feeds (such as
log files) using a message queuing protocol. It's a community driven
initiative called **IHAP** (Incident Handling Automation Project) which
was conceptually designed by European CERTs/CSIRTs during several
InfoSec events. Its main goal is to give to incident responders an easy
way to collect & process threat intelligence thus improving the incident
handling processes of CERTs.

Several pieces of software are evolved around IntelMQ. For an overview,
look at the `Ecosystem document  <docs/Ecosystem.md>`__.

IntelMQ can be used for
- automated incident handling
- situational awareness
- automated notifications
- as data collector for other tools
- etc.

IntelMQ's design was influenced by
`AbuseHelper <https://github.com/abusesa/abusehelper>`__ however it was
re-written from scratch and aims at:

-  Reducing the complexity of system administration
-  Reducing the complexity of writing new bots for new data feeds
-  Reducing the probability of events lost in all process with
   persistence functionality (even system crash)
-  Use and improve the existing Data Harmonization Ontology
-  Use JSON format for all messages
-  Provide easy way to store data into Log Collectors like
   ElasticSearch, Splunk, databases (such as PostgreSQL)
-  Provide easy way to create your own black-lists
-  Provide easy communication with other systems via HTTP RESTful API

It follows the following basic meta-guidelines:

-  Don't break simplicity - KISS
-  Keep it open source - forever
-  Strive for perfection while keeping a deadline
-  Reduce complexity/avoid feature bloat
-  Embrace unit testing
-  Code readability: test with unexperienced programmers
-  Communicate clearly
